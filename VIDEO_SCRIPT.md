# Roam Copilot — Full Video Script (No Installation Section)

Duration: ~5–6 minutes

Notes:

- This is a teleprompter-ready narration script with concise on-screen cues.
- Excludes installation from Roam Depot (not yet listed). Shows features directly.
- Keep pacing brisk; add pattern interrupts every 15–20 seconds (zoom, overlay, quick split).
